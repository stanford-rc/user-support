# User Support

## What is this?

This is a temporary issue board that will be ported to GitHub Discussions
when it is released outside of beta. If you are a user of a Stanford
Resource and have a quesiton, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/stanford-rc/user-support/issues).
Issues from the user list will be represented here, and follow up discussion
will occur here.

## What if I don't have GitHub?

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can still email the user list (e.g.,
`sherlock-users@lists.stanford.edu`) and an issue will be created on your behalf.
While we encourage you to consider creating a GitHub account to participate in
open source contribution, it of course is not required. If you would like for
someone from SRCC to open an issue on your behalf, please contact `srcc-support@stanford.edu`
