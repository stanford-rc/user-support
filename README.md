# User Support

## What is this?

This is a temporary issue board that will be ported to GitHub Discussions
when it is released outside of beta. If you are a user of a Stanford
Resource and have a quesiton, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/stanford-rc/user-support/issues).
Issues from the user list will be represented here, and follow up discussion
will occur here.

## What if I don't have GitHub?

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can still email the user list (e.g.,
`sherlock-users@lists.stanford.edu`) and an issue will be created on your behalf.
While we encourage you to consider creating a GitHub account to participate in
open source contribution, it of course is not required. If you would like for
someone from SRCC to open an issue on your behalf, please contact `srcc-support@stanford.edu`

## What content can I post here?

Whether you ask a question or provide an answer, you should **only post
data that is appropriate for public consumption**. This means that you
should scope questions and responses to be about general software,
setups, etc. For example, if you have a question about something
related to authorization, you should not post it here. If you have
any questions about content, please reach out to `srcc-support@stanford.edu`
with `[github-user-support]` in the title. We reserve the right to edit
or remove any post content that is not suitable for public viewing.

## Should I post questions here for SRCC Support?

Please note that this is a _user support_ forum that will provide structure
for user discussion, and should not be considered a place to post
quesions for the Stanford Research Computing Center support team.
For these questions, and for discussion that cannot be public, we ask
that you continue to use `srcc-support@stanford.edu`.

## Who can ask and answer questions here?

Note that since this is a public repository on GitHub, you can receive responses
from Stanford and non-Stanford folks alike that have GitHub accounts. If you
are concerned about receiving only Stanford-affiliated responses, you should
not post here.
